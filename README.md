# Awesome-Duplication-Finders
Apps to find duplicate files including same/similar images &amp; videos (with computer vision/AI)

## cbird
 Command-line program for managing a media collection, with focus on Content-Based Image Retrieval (Computer Vision) methods for finding duplicates

 ## videoduplicatefinder
 Video Duplicate Finder is a cross-platform software to find duplicated video (and image) files on hard disk based on similiarity. That means unlike other duplicate finders this one does also finds duplicates which have a different resolution, frame rate and even watermarked.

 ## czkawka 
 Czkawka (tchâ€¢kavâ€¢ka (IPA: [ËˆÊ§Ì‘kafka]), "hiccup" in Polish) is a simple, fast and free app to remove unnecessary files from your computer.

## VideoHash
Videohash is a Python package for detecting near-duplicate videos (Perceptual Video Hashing). It can take any input video and generate a 64-bit equivalent hash value. Videohash is way more faster than comparing the imagehash values of individual frames of the video and more reliable than hashing keyframes.  The video-hash-values for identical or near-duplicate videos are the same or similar, implying that if the video is resized (upscaled/downscaled), transcoded, watermark added/removed, stabilized, color changed, frame rate changed, changed aspect ratio, cropped, black-bars added or removed, the hash-value should remain unchanged or not vary substantially.

## DupeGuru
dupeGuru is a cross-platform (Linux, OS X, Windows) GUI tool to find duplicate files in a system. Itâ€™s written mostly in Python 3 and has the peculiarity of using multiple GUI toolkits, all using the same core Python code. On OS X, the UI layer is written in Objective-C and uses Cocoa. On Linux & Windows, itâ€™s written in Python and uses Qt5.

dupeGuru is a tool to find duplicate files on your computer. It can scan either filenames or contents. The filename scan features a fuzzy matching algorithm that can find duplicate filenames even when they are not exactly the same. dupeGuru runs on Mac OS X and Linux.

# Worth mentioning

## video-simili-duplicate-cleaner (OpenSource, Cross-Plattform, MacOS/Windows paid binaries)
Video simili duplicate cleaner is a program that can find duplicate or simply similar video files. Video simili duplicate cleaner compares the actual video content regardless of different format or compression used, while other software only find identical files (digital video fingerprinting). Employs two powerful image comparison methods: pHash (perceptual hashing) and SSIM (structural similarity

## Vidupe 
Vidupe is a program that can find duplicate and similar video files. Normal duplicate file software only finds identical files. Vidupe looks at the actual video content regardless of different format and compression used (digital video fingerprinting.
Simple, easy to use graphical user interface for comparing videos. Multithreaded operation, makes full use of all available CPU threads. Employs two powerful image comparison methods: pHash (perceptual hashing) and SSIM (structural similarity). Cross-platform development: source code available for compiling on Windows/Linux/macOS.

## ndvr
Near Duplicate Video Retrieval

2nd Rank for the Neural Search Hackathon ðŸ¥ˆ

We have witnessed an explosive growth of video data in a variety of video sharing websites with billions of videos being available on the internet, it becomes a major challenge to perform near-duplicate video retrieval (NDVR) from a large-scale video database. NDVR aims to retrieve the near-duplicate videos from a massive video database, where near-duplicate videos are defined as videos that are visually close to the original videos.

Users have a strong incentive to copy a trending short video & upload an augmented version to gain attention. With the growth of short videos, new difficulties and challenges for detecting near duplicate short videos appears.

Here, we have built a Neural Search solution using Jina to solve the challenge of NDVR.
