 ## videoduplicatefinder
 Video Duplicate Finder is a cross-platform software to find duplicated video (and image) files on hard disk based on similiarity. That means unlike other duplicate finders this one does also finds duplicates which have a different resolution, frame rate and even watermarked.

Near Duplicate Video Retrieval

2nd Rank for the Neural Search Hackathon ðŸ¥ˆ

We have witnessed an explosive growth of video data in a variety of video sharing websites with billions of videos being available on the internet, it becomes a major challenge to perform near-duplicate video retrieval (NDVR) from a large-scale video database. NDVR aims to retrieve the near-duplicate videos from a massive video database, where near-duplicate videos are defined as videos that are visually close to the original videos.

Users have a strong incentive to copy a trending short video & upload an augmented version to gain attention. With the growth of short videos, new difficulties and challenges for detecting near duplicate short videos appears.

Here, we have built a Neural Search solution using Jina to solve the challenge of NDVR.
