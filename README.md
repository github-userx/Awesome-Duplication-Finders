# Awesome-Duplication-Finders
Apps to find duplicate files including same/similar images &amp; videos (with computer vision/AI)

## cbird
 Command-line program for managing a media collection, with focus on Content-Based Image Retrieval (Computer Vision) methods for finding duplicates

 ## videoduplicatefinder
 Video Duplicate Finder is a cross-platform software to find duplicated video (and image) files on hard disk based on similiarity. That means unlike other duplicate finders this one does also finds duplicates which have a different resolution, frame rate and even watermarked.

 ## czkawka 
 Czkawka (tchâ€¢kavâ€¢ka (IPA: [ËˆÊ§Ì‘kafka]), "hiccup" in Polish) is a simple, fast and free app to remove unnecessary files from your computer.

## VideoHash
Videohash is a Python package for detecting near-duplicate videos (Perceptual Video Hashing). It can take any input video and generate a 64-bit equivalent hash value. Videohash is way more faster than comparing the imagehash values of individual frames of the video and more reliable than hashing keyframes.  The video-hash-values for identical or near-duplicate videos are the same or similar, implying that if the video is resized (upscaled/downscaled), transcoded, watermark added/removed, stabilized, color changed, frame rate changed, changed aspect ratio, cropped, black-bars added or removed, the hash-value should remain unchanged or not vary substantially.

## ndvr
Near Duplicate Video Retrieval

2nd Rank for the Neural Search Hackathon ðŸ¥ˆ

We have witnessed an explosive growth of video data in a variety of video sharing websites with billions of videos being available on the internet, it becomes a major challenge to perform near-duplicate video retrieval (NDVR) from a large-scale video database. NDVR aims to retrieve the near-duplicate videos from a massive video database, where near-duplicate videos are defined as videos that are visually close to the original videos.

Users have a strong incentive to copy a trending short video & upload an augmented version to gain attention. With the growth of short videos, new difficulties and challenges for detecting near duplicate short videos appears.

Here, we have built a Neural Search solution using Jina to solve the challenge of NDVR.
